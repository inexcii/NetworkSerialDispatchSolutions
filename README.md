# NetworkSerialDispatchSolutions
  Multiple network responses do not arrive as time-serial order when it is requested. 
So I try to find several solutions for a networking issue that response must be orderly received by the same ones of the request.
For example, request 1, 2, 3 should result in response 1, 2, 3 as the order of being received.
